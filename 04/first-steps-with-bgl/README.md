# First Steps with BGL

* minimum spanning tree
* shortest paths

This is a first simple problem to become familiarized with BGL. It can be solved in $\mathcal{O}(n \log n + m \log n)$ by calling the algorithms of Kruskal and Dijkstra. The runtime could be improved further by replacing Dijkstra with BFS or DFS.
